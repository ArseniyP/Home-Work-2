    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <div class="main">
        <p class="big">ACT 1</p>
        <p class="big">PROLOGUE</p>
<pre>Two households, both alike in dignity,
<span class="otherFamily">In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</span>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
<span class="otherFamily">A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</span>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
<span class="otherFamily">And the continuance of their parents' rage,</span>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</pre>
   <p class="big">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</p>
   <p class="text_2">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</p>
    <p class="big">SAMPSON</p>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <p class="big">GREGORY</p>
    <p class="text_3">No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
